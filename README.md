Joke Generator
This project is a simple joke generator built with Vite and TypeScript. It demonstrates how to interact with external APIs to fetch data and how to implement unit tests.

Project Goals
The main objectives of this exercise were:

Understand how an API works: To understand how an API works by making requests to an external service and processing its responses.

Discover other free APIs: To explore and discover various free APIs available for different purposes, broadening the knowledge of external data sources.

Creation of unit tests: To learn and apply the principles of unit testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application's components.

The project was developed using TypeScript for enhanced code quality and maintainability.

⚙️ How to Run the Project
To get this joke generator up and running on your local machine, follow the instructions below.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from nodejs.org.

If you have Vite installed globally or locally:
Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>

(Replace <your-repository-url> with the actual URL of your Git repository and <your-project-folder> with the name of the project directory.)

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install

Start the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

This will start the Vite development server, usually at http://localhost:5173. Open this URL in your web browser.

If you do not have Vite installed:
You don't need to install Vite globally to run this project. Just follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>

(Replace <your-repository-url> with the actual URL of your Git repository and <your-project-folder> with the name of the project directory.)

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install

This command will install all the necessary packages, including Vite, as a local dependency.

Start the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

Vite will automatically be used to serve the project. Open the URL displayed in your terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5173) in your web browser.

Running Tests
To run the unit tests for this project:

npm test
# or
yarn test
# or
